* How to Run
** Front end
   [[https://nhamlv-55.github.io/spacer-visualization]]

** Backend
   - copy the https://github.com/nhamlv-55/spacer-visualization/blob/master/docker-compose.yml to a local directory of your choosing
   - run the following command to spin up both containers for the backend
     =docker-compose up=
   - [OPTIONAL] edit docker containers to pull develop version of containers instead of latest

* Making Changes to the Visualizer
 - clone visualizer repo
   =git clone https://github.com/nhamlv-55/spacer-visualization.git=
   =git clone git@github.com:nhamlv-55/spacer-visualization.git=

 - change to working directory
   =cd spacer-visualization/visualization-frontend=

 - install npm packages
   =npm install=
   
 - run frontend
   =npm start=

* Making Changes to the Backend
  - clone both repos
    =git clone https://github.com/aishr/SpacerVisBackend.git=
    =git clone https://github.com/aishr/SpacerProseBackend.git=
  - edit one of the docker-compose.yml so =build:= points to the directories of each of the backends
  - run =docker-compose up= in the same directory as your edited =docker-compose.yml=
